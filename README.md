# Bio5702

Welcome to the phenotyping module of **Bio5702**, [*Current Approaches in Plant Research*](http://dbbs.wustl.edu/curstudents/Documents/syllabi/BIOL%205702_S16.pdf), a graduate course at Washington Unviersity in St. Louis. Over the next few weeks, we'll be exploring methods related to high-throughput phenotyping, including:

* Learning computational statistics with [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
* Image analysis
* Morphometrics
* Multivariate statistics

You will be collecting your own data to analyze. The subject matter is: 75 different types of *candy*. In the next few weeks, you will measure 1000s of individual pieces of candy and analyze your dataset using multivariate statistics. The traits you will measure range from nutritional to morphometric to anything that you can thing of (including *taste!*).

This module was inspired by the video [*The Taxonomy of Candy*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3amU3RrX9g) by [Emily Graslie](https://twitter.com/Ehmee). You can follow along on twitter for the course using the hashtag [#CandyPhenotyping](https://twitter.com/hashtag/candyphenotyping).

## [March 30, 2016](https://github.com/DanChitwood/Bio5702/tree/master/March_30_2016)

The first lecture of this series will be an introduction to the statistical computing software environment [R](https://www.r-project.org/). In class, we will make sure everybody has downloaded R and go over the introduction together ([script](https://github.com/DanChitwood/Bio5702/blob/master/March_30_2016/Intro_to_R.R), [PDF](https://github.com/DanChitwood/Bio5702/blob/master/March_30_2016/Intro_to_R.pdf)). The initial [dataset](https://github.com/DanChitwood/Bio5702/blob/master/March_30_2016/candy_nutrition.txt) we will use to learn R is the nutritional information of our 75 different candy types. At the end to the lecture, you should be able to:

1. Read data into R
2. Manipulate and format dataframes
3. Create stunning visualziations using the [ggplot2](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/) package
4. Perform descriptive statistics and initial data explroation

## April 1, 2016

The beginning of this lecture we will go over the remainder of the ggplot2 [tutorial](https://github.com/DanChitwood/Bio5702/blob/master/March_30_2016/Intro_to_R.R). Your homework for this lecture is to create three graphs using ggplot2 that explore the nutritional candy dataset. We will go over your ggplot2 graphs in class next lecture.

For the remainder of this lecture, Chris gave a [presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/ChristopherTopp1/2016-bio4025-lecture1-final) introducing image analysis

## [April 4, 2016](https://github.com/DanChitwood/Bio5702/tree/master/April_4_2016)

The results from the homework assignment to make three [ggplots](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/) using the [candy_nutrition.txt](https://github.com/DanChitwood/Bio5702/blob/master/April_4_2016/ggplot2_homework/candy_nutrition.txt) dataset, the nutrition information for 75 different candy types, has been [posted](https://github.com/DanChitwood/Bio5702/tree/master/April_4_2016/ggplot2_homework).

You can view the homework in your browser as [html](https://cdn.rawgit.com/DanChitwood/Bio5702/master/April_4_2016/student_homework.html) too.

Chris continued with the image analysis [presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/ChristopherTopp1/2016-bio4025-lecture1-final) and an [introduction to image analysis in FIJI](https://github.com/DanChitwood/Bio5702/blob/master/April_4_2016/2016_FIJI_GettingStarted.md). The [FIJI](http://fiji.sc/) introduction is viewable as [markdown](https://github.com/DanChitwood/Bio5702/blob/master/April_4_2016/2016_FIJI_GettingStarted.md) or downloadable as a [Word file](https://github.com/DanChitwood/Bio5702/blob/master/April_4_2016/2016_FIJI_GettingStarted.docx).

## April 6, 2016

Phenotyping went great today! Chris has posted all your photos to [DropBox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/uzg7iv9d3e8ev1p/AAD-ipam19wSXWn9HJ8Q8x-La?dl=0). Homework for Friday is to cull duplicate/bad pictures and rename the files with the identification numbers before 10am on Friday. On Friday, you will use FIJI to make masks and gather data (feature extraction).
